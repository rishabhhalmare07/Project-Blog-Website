                    <br>
                    <h3>Highlight</h3>
                        <p>
                    <i>Paris</i> is the <u> capital</u> and most populous city of france
                    Paris has been one of Europe's major centres of finance, diplomacy, commerce, fashion, science
                    and arts.
                    Paris is especially known for its museums and architectural landmarks:
                    <b>The Eiffel Tower</b>Probably the best-known landmark in Europe, is as much a symbol of Paris
                    as the
                    Statue of Liberty is a symbol of New York. When completed, the 300m tower was the tallest
                    building in the world. Built for the Exposition Universelle in 1889, the construction was only
                    meant to last for the duration of the fair. The tower still stands today, despite protests from
                    people who feared that this huge 'object' would not fit into the architecture of Paris. Today,
                    there is no such aversion among the Parisians. At night, the tower is illuminated from within,
                    its sweeping searchlight giving it the appearance of a huge urban lighthouse. You can climb up
                    the stairs or take the elevator after waiting in the (long) queue.

                    <b>The Louvre</b> was the most visited visited art museum in the world in 2019, with 9.6 million
                    visitors.The Louvre is one of the largest museums in the world. Situated in the heart of Paris,
                    along the right bank of the Seine, this palace is a must-see sight, both from an architectural
                    point of view and from an arts perspective. It displays about 300,000 works, including Venus de
                    Milo, Winged Victory and Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The immense collection was displayed for
                    the first time in 1789 during the French Revolution. The Classical 16th century palace has
                    undergone numerous changes over the centuries. The latest addition was in the late 1980s when
                    François Mitterrand added a futuristic steel-and-glass pyramid in the middle of its courtyard.
                    The pyramid allows sunlight to come in on the underground floor.</p>

                    <b> The Notre-Dame</b> is one of the most famous cathedrals in the world. The
                    site of the Gothic masterpiece has long been the religious center of the city; the Celts had
                    their sacred ground here, the Romans chose the site to build a temple to worship Jupiter and a
                    Christian basilica was built here in the 6th century. Construction on the cathedral commenced in
                    1163. It was the first cathedral to be built on a monumental scale, and it became the prototype
                    for future cathedrals in France (such as those of Amiens, Chartres or Rheims). Completed in
                    1345, the result is an overwhelming building 130m long with two 69 meters tall towers. The
                    spire, which reaches 90m, was added in the 19th century by Viollet-le-Duc. The 21-metre-high
                    northern 13th century rose window is the most impressive of the numerous rose windows.</p>

                    <b>The Musée Picasso</b> is housed in the magnificent 17th century Hôtel Salé. It is the largest
                    collection of Picassos anywhere, representing almost all the major periods of the artist's life
                    from 1905 onwards. The result is a sense of the artist's development and an insight into the
                    person behind the myth. The museum also holds a substantial number of Picasso's engravings,
                    ceramics and sculpture. In addition, the collection includes paintings Picasso bought or was
                    given by contemporaries such as Matisse and Cézanne; his African masks and sculptures; his
                    Communist party membership cards and sketches of Stalin; and photographs of him in his studio
                    taken by Brassaï.</p>

                    <b>The Arc de Triomphe,</b> was commissioned by Napoleon in
                    1806 to commemorate his victories, but he was ousted before the arch was completed. Completed in
                    1836, the Arc de Triomphe is adorned with many reliefs, most of them commemorating battles. The
                    best known relief is the Departure of the Volunteers in 1792, also known as the Marseillaise. At
                    the top of the arch are 30 shields, each of them bears the name of one of Napoleon's successful
                    battles. The arch features an observatory from where you have great views of La Defense, the
                    Champs-Elysées and the Sacré-Coeur.</p>
                </p>
                Paris received 38 million visitors in 2019, measured by hotel stays, with the largest numbers of
                foreign visitors coming from the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and China. It
                was ranked as the second most visited travel destination in the world in 2019, after Bangkok and
                just ahead of London. The football club Paris Saint-Germain and the rugby union club Stade
                Français are based in Paris.
                Paris hosts the annual French Open Grand Slam tennis tournament on the red clay of Roland
                Garros. The city hosted the Olympic Games in 1900, 1924 and will host the 2024 Summer Olympics.
                The 1938 and 1998 FIFA World Cups, the 2007 Rugby World Cup, as well as the 1960, 1984 and 2016
                UEFA European Championships were also held in the city. Every July, the Tour de France bicycle
                race finishes on the Avenue des Champs-Élysées in Paris.
                Paris is located in northern central France, in a north-bending arc of the river Seine whose
                crest includes two islands, the Île Saint-Louis and the larger Île de la Cité, which form the
                oldest part of the city. The river's mouth on the English Channel (La Manche) is about 233 mi
                (375 km) downstream from the city. The city is spread widely on both banks of the river.

                The most exquisite of Paris' Gothic gems, Sainte Chapelle is tucked away within the walls of the
                Palais de Justice. The chapel is illuminated by a curtain of luminous 13th-century stained glass
                (the oldest and finest in Paris). The Sainte Chapelle consists of two chapels - the dark lower
                chapel, with its star-painted ceiling, was intended for the servants, while the upper chapel,
                reached via a spiral staircase, was reserved for the court. The upper chapel is a dazzling
                sight, its walls made almost entirely of stained glass held up by powerful supports, which the
                medieval builders cleverly crafted to appear delicate and fragile by dividing them into clusters
                of pencil-thin columns.
